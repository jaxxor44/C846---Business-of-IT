# Incident Management
>[!tip] Key Message
>Incident Management seeks to reduce the impact of negative incidents, and return service to normal operation ASAP.
- An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction of quality.
	- must be logged, prioritized and managed through their lifecycle.
	- Uses same categorization system as problem tickets
- Major incidents: need a separate procedure. 
- Depending on the severity of the incident, a temporary team may be formed to address the issue.
- Swarming approach
	- Swarming can be used for quicker solutions.
	- Can be used for complex problems ie. open the floor to any suggestions.
- If the Incident is severe enough it could trigger a disaster recovery plan, as outlined in a continuity management practice.
- Using IT service management tools to provide a history of similar errors and knowledge about the subject is critical for high quality of service.
- The formal process for logging and managing incidents doesn't typically include detailed troubleshooting guides/procedures. This is to prevent misdiagnosis from low level incident handlers.

- Obviously, Incident management is almost entirely engagement and support practices.
>[!example] Axle Car Hire 🏢 Incident Management
>👵__Radhika__ : Axle Faces many potential IT and non-IT incidents. Cars can break down, accidents occur, customers face challenges with unfamiliar roads.
>👲__Marco__ : A car booking can be affected by an error in our app or by a user getting lost in the software. When incidents occur, we need to be ready to restore service ASAP. Our team also needs to know when to switch from pre-defined recovery procedures to swarming and collective analysis.
>👵__Radhika__ : We also make sure that such cases are followed by investigation and improvement.
>👨__Henri__ : Axle has developed clear processes for all types of incidents with workarounds for frequent problems, like tire damage and loss of internet.
>👵__Radhika__ : Our teams work together with our suppliers and partners to ensure fact and effective incident response. We develop and test recovery procedures together with partners involved in any incidents we experience.
