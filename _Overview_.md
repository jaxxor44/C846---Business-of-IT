## From WGU Professors
1. Immediately Request approval for the third-party exam voucher
HOW: on the course of study page, scroll down to the Assessments section and then click on request voucher approval.
WHY: you're not being rushed: the voucher is valid for several months - this gets the voucher in your hands now to avoid delays later.

Once requested, you'll receive an approval email. Following the instructions in the approval email, Click on the Schedule Now Button and Submit. The WGU system will send an email about the PoepleCert.org site where you'll schedule and take the actual assessment using a unique voucher in the email to Schedule and take the Axelos ITIL Foundations certification exam.

2. Read the 5 chapters in the e-textbook in the course material
HOW:  Click on the "GO TO COURSE MATERIAL" button in the Course of Study page.
WHY: Do your best to get the "big" picture; don't worry about details (they'll come in step #4).
It's a reference book and you don't need to know everything. The LinkedIN introductory videos can be helpful, but don't be afraid to skip them (especially "rants" about ITIL version 3)

3. Print out the Axelos Syllabus
HOW: Click on (LINK HERE<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XnGB_GUX4VM9WfRoa8TpJGasvXgKE4Wp/view?usp=3Dsharing>) to download the Syllabus.
WHY: The Assessment Criteria column on pp. 4-5 tells you exactly what's on the test (you must know these).

4. Print out the Dion Training Guide and/or the Dion Cram Sheet PDFs
HOW: For the Dion Training Guide PDF (LINK HERE<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCWWlhErbzGx_2wNJoaktD4sIqqk-tuw/view?usp=3Dsharing>) and for the Dion Cram Sheet PDF (LINK HERE<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgmlNXMsy9aobmqWS2AoemZc6qRFvAab/view?usp=3Dsharing>) to download   .
WHY: To create a "capture" document(s) that are highlighted. The highlighted sections should have 90 to 95% of what you need and can be reviewed within 20 minutes right before the actual test.
MORE DETAILS: Using the Assessment Criteria column in the Syllabus, highlight to "capture" the Assessment Criteria column (alternatives: your own notes, and/or Flash cards, etc.).  IMHO: The Training Guide has too much material (why you need to highlight it) *** vs. *** the Cram Sheet may be too condensed (may need to add to it). Hybrid: start with the Training Guide (skim it), review the Cram Sheet (skim it), and review against the "Assessment Criteria" column of the Syllabus (make your own choice of what will work best for you).

5. View the ITIL 4 Foundations (Value Insight) video series
HOW: Click to (LINK HERE<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/d65OCjRgoqCY93NMlcWAHCi?domain=3Dyoutube.com>) for the listing of videos hosted on YouTube.
WHY: These videos are an explanation of what you'll need for the test and will help you to highlight "Assessment Criteria" items (from step #4).

6. Take practice test in the course material
HOW: Click on the "GO TO COURSE MATERIAL" button in the Course of Study page. Under the "Exam Readiness" area and "Exam Information and Practice Tests") NOTE: For the first login to these resources on UDEMY, you may need to register and then enroll the question banks.
WHY: Each question will help you focus on a concept or term that you'll need to understand. As you miss a question, it will help refine your "capture" document(s)  from step #4.

7. Take the Axelos practice test
HOW: Click on (LINK HERE<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2OcemZEjumCyLFKF-eVPiAt_sMLp_vQ/view?usp=3Dsharing>) to download the PDF of the questions, answers, and explanations.
WHY: This is the best look you can get of the test without actually taking it. It will help you acclimate with "wording" and "testology" phrasing of questions.

8. If everything is going well:  take the actual test
HOW: Using the information from the WGU system email in step #1, schedule a date and time to take the actual test at PeopleCert.org .
WHY: Finish up and move on to your next course :) .

9. After passing: Notify WGU
HOW: Email your certificate PDF to scores@wgu.edu<mailto:scores@wgu.edu> with a cc: to your program mentor and mj.jordan@wgu.edu<mailto:mj.jordan@wgu.edu> .
WHY: To get credit for this course (and show a completion in your degree plan).
