# value and value co-creation
>[!tip] Key Message
>The purpose of an organization is to create value for stakeholders.

- _Value_ is defined as the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something.
- Originally service providers viewed their relationship with consumers as _mono-directional_.
- With ITIL, value is created using the relationship formed between consumers and producers.
- Relying on collaborators in the service value chain to establish __mutually beneficial__ relationships.
