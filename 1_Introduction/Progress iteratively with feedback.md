# Progress iteratively with feedback
- Don't try to do everything at once
- have more feedback loops
- work in smaller manageable chunks done more often.
- Use feedback in each iteration to ensure actions are appropriate to the goals.
- Continuously feedback and develop.
- baby steps and get lots of feedback.
