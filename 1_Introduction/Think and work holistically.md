# Think and work holistically
- Work on the service, not just its parts.
- Integrate information, technology, organization, people, practices, partners and agreements.
- Use "Up and out thinking" also called synthetic thinking
	- sparingly use "down and in" thinking, called analytical thinking
- Work on the system, not just the parts.
- Have a good big picture view.
- defeat silo thinking
