- A key element of Service Level management is engaging with your users for feedback.
- Metrics can appear all green, but without user feedback, you'd never know what frustrates your users.
- Levels of service can be defined by metrics.
- Customer engagement sounds like
	- What does your work involve?
	- how does technology help you?
	- What your key business times, areas, people, and activities?
