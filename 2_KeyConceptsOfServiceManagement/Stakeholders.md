	FUNDIMENTALS:
	- Focus on concepts, and conceptual note taking.
	- use __highlighting__ to _articulate_ points.
	- Have the Key message right up front.
	- Anki cards should be added/edited whenever the note is edited.
	- Link as you go. One good link is worth more than a sentence that can come back. %%
