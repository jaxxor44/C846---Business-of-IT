# Problem Management
>[!tip] Key Message
>The goal of problem management is to reduce the likelihood and impact of an incident by identifying accidental/potential causes of incidents. As well as manage workarounds and known errors.
- Focus on root cause to get the train back on track.
- Problem:
	- An unknown cause of ONE OR MORE incidents
- Known error:
	- A problem with a known root cause, but no solution yet.
- Workarounds
	- an alternate solution, reducing the impact of the problem.
- Problems vs incidents
	- Incidents have an impact on users/business processes, and must be resolved so normal operations can continue.
	- Problems are the CAUSE of the incident. Require investigation/analysis to develop solutions/workarounds/long term fixes.

- **Problem Identification** is the act of identifying that there is a problem at all.
	- Preform trend analysis of incident records
	- detection of duplicate/recurring issues. Major or minor.
	- Analyzing data from suppliers/partners.
	- Analyzing data from internal teams, test teams, project teams.
- **Problem Control** document workarounds, analysis of the problem, and known errors.
	- Prioritize problems based on the risk they pose.
	- Its not essential to analyze every problem, its better to make significant progress on the highest priority problems first.
	- Consider what caused the incident, and what contributed to its ongoing or prevention from being solved.
	- Consider a problem from all 4 perspectives of Service Management.
- **Error Control** The practice of fixing an error Via Long term solution, workaround or known error.
	- Regularly re-assess the status of known errors that have not been resolved, to see if a solution exists yet. (Find solutions from the 4 perspectives of service management)
	- Problem management and risk management often complement eachother.
