# Configuring services for value
>[!tip] Key Message
>The services that an organization provides are based on one or more of its products. Organizations own or have access to a variety of resources, including people, information and technology, value streams and processes, and partners and suppliers. Products are _configurations_ of these resources, created by the organization, that will potentially be viable for its customers.

[[ITIL Foundation, ITIL 4 Edition (Book).pdf#page=25|ITIL Foundations Book]].
- Services
	- A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
- Product
	- A configuration of an organization's resources designed to offer value for a consumer.
